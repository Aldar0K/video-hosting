### Coding Environmet
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- React.js
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Folow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenewer possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classed for styling HTML elements. Avoid using CSS or inline styles unless there is complex or impossible styling via tailwind, such as using webkit.
- Use descriptive variable and function / const names. Also, event functions should be name with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
- Prefer Function Expression with a const variable over Function Declaration
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex="0", aria-lable, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes. Here you can rely on Tailwind and Shadcn.
